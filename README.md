# CIRISNode

> Alignment & governance back-plane for the CIRIS ecosystem  
> Status: **DEVELOPMENT â€” functional with stubbed integrations**

---

## 1  Overview

CIRISNode is the remote utility that CIRISAgent clients will call for:

- **Alignment benchmarking** (Annex J HE-300 suite)  
- **Governance workflows** (Event recording)  

---

## 2  Core Responsibilities

1. **Alignment API**  
   Runs HE-300 scenarios, returns signed benchmark reports.

2. **WBD API**  
   Receives Wisdom-Based Deferral packages and streams replies.

3. **Audit Anchoring**
   Publishes daily SHA-256 digests of logs and benchmark results for transparency.

---

## 3  API Endpoints

### ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

This section provides detailed, step-by-step instructions to set up and run CIRISNode on your local machine or in a Docker container. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a successful setup.

#### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**: Ensure Python 3.10 or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: Required to clone the repository. Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Docker**: Optional, for containerized setup. Install Docker Desktop from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- **Virtual Environment**: Recommended for isolating project dependencies.
- **Streamlit**: Required for the frontend web application. Install via pip if running locally.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone cirisai/cirisnode  # As per FSD
cd cirisnode
```

#### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` for the backend, and additional packages for the frontend.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install streamlit
```

#### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the necessary environment variables. Use the following template as a starting point:

TODO: CLEAN UP ENV VARIABLES

#### Step 5: Run the Server Locally

To run the FastAPI server locally, you need to export the required environment variables and use `uvicorn` to start the server. Use the following command:

```bash
export ENVIRONMENT='dev' && export JWT_SECRET='temporary_secret' && uvicorn cirisnode.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

- **`ENVIRONMENT='dev'`**: Sets the environment to development mode.
- **`JWT_SECRET='temporary_secret'`**: Sets the secret key for JWT authentication.
- **`uvicorn cirisnode.main:app --reload --port 8000`**: Starts the FastAPI server with auto-reload enabled on port 8000.

Once the server is running:
- Access the health check endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health` to confirm the server is operational (should return `{"status": "ok", "message": "Service is healthy", "timestamp": "2025-05-08T14:52:00Z"}`).
- Explore the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs` (available in `dev` or `test` environments).

#### Step 6: Run the Streamlit Frontend Locally

To run the Streamlit frontend application, use the following command in a separate terminal:

```bash
export ENVIRONMENT='dev' && streamlit run frontend_eee/main.py
```

- **`ENVIRONMENT='dev'`**: Ensures the frontend connects to the development backend.
- The frontend will run on `http://localhost:8501`.
- Use the web interface to interact with CIRISNode functionalities, such as submitting deferral requests and managing benchmarks.

#### Step 7: Run the Test Suite Locally

Ensure your environment is set to `test` by setting `ENVIRONMENT=test` in your `.env` file or by using environment variables in the command. Install test dependencies if not already installed, then run the tests.

```bash
export JWT_SECRET='temporary_secret' && pytest tests/ -v
```

- Tests cover health checks, JWT authentication, benchmark workflows, and more.
- Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set to enable JWT authentication for protected routes during testing.

#### Step 8: Run Using Docker (Optional)

For a containerized setup, use Docker Compose to build and run CIRISNode.

```bash
docker compose up --build # For local development as per FSD
```

- Maps port 8000 on your host to port 8000 in the container.
- Uses the `.env` file for environment variables.
- Access the health check at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`.

3. **View Container Logs**

```bash
docker logs cirisnode
```

4. **Stop the Container**

```bash
docker stop cirisnode
docker rm cirisnode
```

#### Step 9: Run Tests in Docker (Optional)

To run the test suite inside a Docker container, modify the Dockerfile or create a separate test image.

1. **Create a Test Dockerfile or Modify Existing**

Add the following to your `Dockerfile` or create a separate `Dockerfile.test`:

```dockerfile
# Install test dependencies
RUN pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-env httpx

# Copy test files
COPY ./tests /app/tests

# Set environment for testing
ENV ENVIRONMENT=test

# Command to run tests
CMD ["pytest", "-v", "tests/"]
```

2. **Build and Run Test Container**

```bash
docker build -t cirisnode-test:latest -f Dockerfile.test .
docker run --rm --env-file .env cirisnode-test:latest
```

- `--rm` automatically removes the container after execution.
- Outputs test results to the console.

#### Step 10: Export OpenAPI Specification

If you want to save the OpenAPI specification for documentation or client generation:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/openapi.json > docs/api-spec/openapi.json
```

- Ensure the server is running on port 8000.
- The OpenAPI JSON will be saved to `docs/api-spec/openapi.json`.

### Errors and Troubleshooting

- **Connection Reset by Peer or "Not Found" Error when accessing http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health**: This error occurs if the server is not running or if you are trying to access the wrong port. Ensure the server is running on `http://localhost:8000` by using the command `export JWT_SECRET='temporary_secret' && uvicorn cirisnode.main:app --reload --port 8000`. If using Docker, verify the port mapping with `-p 8000:8000` in your `docker run` command. If the issue persists, check if the server or container is running with `ps aux | grep uvicorn` or `docker ps`, and restart if necessary.

- **Docker Build Fails with "No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'"**: This happens if `requirements.txt` is missing or not in the project root. Generate it by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your virtual environment before building the image. Ensure the file is committed to the repository if cloning from GitHub.

- **Unable to Access API Endpoints**: If endpoints return errors or are inaccessible:
  - Confirm the server is running (`ps aux | grep uvicorn` or `docker ps` for containers).
  - Check logs for startup errors (`docker logs <container_id>` if using Docker).
  - Verify the `.env` file exists and contains required variables like `JWT_SECRET`, or use `export JWT_SECRET='temporary_secret'` in the command. Ensure `--env-file .env` is used in `docker run` commands.
  - Test the health endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`. A response of `{"status": "ok", "message": "Service is healthy", "timestamp": "2025-05-08T14:52:00Z"}` indicates the server is operational.
  - Access the interactive Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs` to explore and test endpoints directly from a browser (available in `dev` or `test` environments). Note that some endpoints require authentication headers.

- **Test Failures Due to Environment Configuration**: If tests fail with authentication errors, ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set as an environment variable when running `pytest`. This enables JWT authentication for protected routes during testing.


- **General Dependency Issues**: If `pip install` fails or dependencies conflict, ensure you're using Python 3.10+ and a clean virtual environment. Remove and recreate the virtual environment if needed (`rm -rf venv && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`).

- **Streamlit App Not Connecting to Backend**: If the Streamlit app at `http://localhost:8501` fails to connect to the backend, ensure the server is running on `http://localhost:8000`. Check for errors in the Streamlit interface and server logs. Restart both the server and Streamlit app if necessary.

- **SQLAlchemy Errors in Tests**: If you encounter SQLAlchemy errors related to textual SQL expressions, ensure you're using the `text()` function from `sqlalchemy.sql` to wrap all SQL queries. For example, use `db.execute(text("SELECT * FROM active_tasks"))` instead of `db.execute("SELECT * FROM active_tasks")`.
